## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to run and test
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
- [k6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/) - to test

Note that we use [AWS S3 service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to upload image,
[setup your own](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html) S3 bucket if you want to test uploading image.

### Migrate the database

After [setting up your database locally](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-createdb.html),
run this to migrate our database structure
```
$ migrate -source file://path/to/migrations -database postgres://localhost:5432/database up 2
```

### Running the service

A step by step series of that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Create file named .env and fill it with, example:
```
HTTP_PORT = 8001
BASE_URL = http://localhost:8000
DB_HOST = localhost
DB_PORT = 5432
DB_USERNAME = root
DB_PASSWORD = pass12345
DB_NAME = shopifyx
BCRYPT_SALT = 12
MIGRATIONS_URI = file:///path/to/migrations/shopifyx-marketplace/internal/common/db/migrations
JWT_SECRET = ${JWT_SECRET}
S3_ID = ${S3_ID}
S3_REGION = ${S3_REGION}
S3_SECRET_KEY = ${S3_SECRET_KEY}
S3_BUCKET_NAME = ${S3_BUCKET_NAME}
JWT_TTL = 7200
```

Run the service

    go run cmd/main.go

Now you can run the service.

[clone this test script](https://github.com/nandanugg/MarketplaceTestCases) outside of this project directory, and then run:
```
$ k6 run script.js
```

To run with certain number of iterations and virtual users:
```
$ k6 run -i NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS --vus NUMBER_OF_VIRTUAL_USERS script.js
```
